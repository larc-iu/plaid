;; Sliding an edit to the tokens
;;
;; A delete or an insert that has the same letters on one side as at its far
;; end can stand in several places for the same resulting string. The trim in
;; `diff` takes the shared start as far as it goes, so it always picks the
;; last of them, and that cuts words: deleting `cat` from `the cat cow` shares
;; `the c` at the start, the delete falls on `at c`, and `cat`'s tokens are
;; left on `c` and `cow`'s on `ow`. Deleting `cat ` instead gives the same
;; body and leaves `cow` whole. Editscript's own choices inside a changed
;; stretch have the same freedom.

(defn- slide-cost
  "How many of `tokens` an edit at this place would disturb. It cuts a token
  a delete takes part of, one a delete swallows while it stands at a single
  point, and one an insert falls strictly inside of. It also disturbs a token
  whose neighbouring letter it changes: inserting `t ta` after the `ta` of
  `cat ta bad` leaves that token on the start of the new `tat`, where
  inserting `tat ` before it leaves it between the same two spaces. An
  insert where two tokens of one layer meet disturbs at least one of them,
  even with the same letters either side: an `a` typed at the end of `aa`,
  glossed as `a` + `a`, would otherwise go between the two morphemes, inside
  the word but in neither. A zero-width token where a token begins and no
  token of a layer that is not a partition ends marks that token's start, and
  text inserted there comes between the two, whatever its first letter:
  `a ` typed before `abc` leaves the marker on the new `a`, where ` a` typed
  after the word before leaves it on `abc`. It counts half, so it settles
  ties and never outweighs a token the text would go inside.

  A layer in `partitioning` has no gaps, so text inserted where two of its
  tokens meet goes into one of them (see `apply-plain-gaps`): the one
  beginning there when the text stands past whitespace on that token's
  first line, or right after the punctuation the token before ends on, else
  the one ending there (and at the start of the text the first). That token
  counts as disturbed there, as it does for an insert inside it, and the
  one beginning there, when the one ending there takes the text, if its
  letter before changes. Doubling the `a` of `tat! a. tat` before the `a`
  gives it to the second sentence, as doubling it after the `a` does.

  A delete that cuts a token at one end and leaves it ending (or beginning)
  on a space it did not have there counts that token half again, so of the
  two ways to delete a word at the edge of a token over several words (a
  UMR node), the one taking the space on the far side wins.

  A word token (one on a layer in `word-layers`) made only of punctuation
  (see `punct-only?`, `letter-like` as there) takes no text typed against
  it, so an insert at its edge disturbs nothing there."

  delete that stands before an insert at a token's end moved up to it the
  same way, when the token holds the letters then deleted. The diff can keep
  a word's letters from a different place than the one that was respelled:
  `kaki é` to `QЖki` came out as `QЖ` typed before `kaki`, its `ak` deleted
  and ` é` deleted, which leaves the typed letters out of the word, where
  `ka` deleted with them is one respelling of it that the word's token
  holds. When the delete cannot move so, the kept letters may be the last
  of the token instead, and the letters before them are deleted: `tat on`
  to `Zڤt` keeps the last `t` of `tat` (and the first of a token ending at
  the insert, in the mirror case). Only letters typed without a space, since
  a new word typed in front of a word stays out of it, and only edits apart

;; The diff is a minimal edit script over characters and knows nothing about
;; tokens, so when a deleted stretch is followed by text that repeats its
;; edge it may keep the "wrong" copy: deleting `¿Qué? ` from `¿Qué? ? dog's`
;; can come out as delete `¿Qué`, keep `?`, delete ` ?` — same resulting
;; string, but the kept `?` is the tail of the `¿Qué?` token, which survives
;; as a one-character sliver (with its annotations and links) while the real
;; `?` token is deleted. When two deletes straddle a kept run that equals an
;; edge of the neighbouring deleted text, the pair is equivalent to ONE
;; contiguous delete; prefer that form whenever it cuts fewer tokens.
