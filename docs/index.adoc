**Plaid** is a platform for developers of linguistic annotation apps.
It provides many foundational backend systems, including a user system, a modular data model, and a lossless database.
Plaid provides this common functionality so that you can focus on developing your app front-end in JavaScript or any other programming language of your choosing.

Some distinguishing features of Plaid:

* **Effortless Collaboration**: since Plaid is a web platform, all users read and write to a single database. There is no need for manual synchronization or movement of data.
* **Customizable Data Model**: Plaid provides _layers_ which allow you to tailor the data model you use for an app on a per-project basis.
* **Time-traveling Database**: unlike with a traditional SQL server, Plaid's database is lossless ("immutable"), allowing you to **view every past state** your documents were ever in. Additionally, an audit log allows you to see every operation that has been performed.
* **AI Model Integration**: Plaid offers a powerful client-to-client communication system, making it easy to make apps which are deeply integrated with AI models.

== Quick Start

1. Find the latest release and download `plaid.jar`: <https://github.com/larc-iu/plaid/releases>
2. With https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/[JDK 21 or later], use `java` to run the JAR: `java -jar plaid.jar`
3. Enter an admin username and password when prompted.
4. Visit <http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs/> to ensure the server is running.
5. Any files under `resources/` (a sister directory of `plaid.jar`) will be served: `resources/index.html`, for example, would be served at <http://localhost:8080/index.html>.

That's it!

== Example App: UD Editor

To get a feel for how to program an app with Plaid, it may be helpful to see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ld9tfHBqF4gwQTOn0mBtHVDllcHCUwdZ/view?usp=sharing[an example app for UD editing].
(Cf. https://github.com/larc-iu/plaid/tree/master/examples/ud_editor[source code].)
