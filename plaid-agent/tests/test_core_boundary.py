"""The core must not know what any app annotates.

The harness is shared by every app's assistant, and the way it stops being
shared is one app's word creeping into it: a key prefix, a default, a phrase
in a docstring that only makes sense for interlinear text. Each of those
compiles and passes every other test, and is found later by the second app
finding it wrong.

So: the app's name does not appear in ``core/`` at all, and the app's own
modules are not importable from it.
