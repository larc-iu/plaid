# What's this?

An app for annotating linguistic data that's still under construction. It's built using [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)([Script](https://clojurescript.org/)), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Fulcro](https://fulcro.fulcrologic.com/), and [Crux](https://opencrux.com/main/index.html). Check back soon ðŸš§

# How do I run this? 
There's not much to look at presently, but if you really want to:

```
# in one session
$ make fe 
# in another session
$ make start-dev-server
clojure -A:dev
Clojure 1.10.1
user=> (start)
# navigate to localhost:8085
```
